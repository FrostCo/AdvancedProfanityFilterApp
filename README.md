# Advanced Profanity Filter App
This project helps remove profanity from standalone files in batches. It uses the same filter engine and configuration as the web version: [Advanced Profanity Filter](https://github.com/richardfrost/AdvancedProfanityFilter).

### Usage
**Warning** Very rough initial release.

1. Run the app
2. Drag a `.json` config file (can be exported from the web extension) into the config bar at the top.
3. Drag the desired files to the "Drag your files here" area. A summary of the files will be output below. Process files will be saved alongside the original file with the prefix `clean-`.
